# Foundation

My personal foundation.

This repo will include all my public software, scripts, configs and CI system.

## What is this repo?

My github repo aggregation.

I've manage too many repositories, that I have to combine them to one so that I can manage them easily.

## Repos

- [nodejs](nodejs)
    - [scripts](nodejs/scripts)

## Commit Message Type
Must be one of the following:

* feat: A new feature

* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* perf: A code change that improves performance
* test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
* chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
